## Publishing
To publish, your GitHub package credentials must be stored in the system environment.

```sh
export GITHUB_ACTOR=<username>
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<token>

./gradlew publish
```

The token can be generated from your [developer settings](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
